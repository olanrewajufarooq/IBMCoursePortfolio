            My expertise includes designing and managing databases, ensuring data integrity, and optimizing performance for both relational and NoSQL systems. 
            I have extensive experience deploying applications and microservices on cloud platforms such as Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and AWS. 
            Proficient in containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, I specialize in building scalable and maintainable microservices architectures.
